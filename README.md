# SwiftUI Instrument Workshop â€” Swift Island 2025

This repository contains the sample projects for the **SwiftUI Instrument** workshop, prepared and presented by **Sofia Diniz** at the **2025 edition of Swift Island**.  

The repository includes two demo apps, **WaitUpHangs** and **WaitUpHitches**, each intentionally built with performance issues for you to diagnose and fix using Xcodeâ€™s Instruments.  

---

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- macOS 26  
- iOS 26  
- Xcode **Beta 7** (or later)  
- The WaitUp projects (included in this repository)  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Workshop Goals  

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:  

1. Understand **what Instruments is**.  
2. Recognize the **advantages of using Instruments** in app development.  
3. Learn **what the SwiftUI Instrument does**.  
4. Use it to **diagnose performance issues** in SwiftUI apps.  
5. Identify and fix **common performance issues**.

## ðŸ›  Projects Overview  

### ðŸš¦ WaitUpHitches  
This project is intentionally filled with issues that cause **frame drops and laggy animations** (commonly known as *hitches*).  

Youâ€™ll use Instruments to:  
- Profile the app.  
- Detect the causes of animation hitches.  
- Apply the workshopâ€™s solution guidelines to optimize performance.  

---

### ðŸ•’ WaitUpHangs  
This project has a noticeable **hang (freeze)** when opening the `OrdersView`.  

Youâ€™ll use Instruments â€” particularly the **SwiftUI Instrument** and **Time Profiler** â€” to:  
- Identify what causes the hang.  
- Optimize the code.  
- Implement a caching system.  
- Leverage **SwiftUIâ€™s lazy loading views** for better performance.
